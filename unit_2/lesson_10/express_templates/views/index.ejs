<%# let name = "Kabelo"; %>
<!-- 
  This line is an EJS *comment*.
  - The <%# ... %> syntax is used for comments that are ignored by both
    the server and the client (they won't appear in the rendered HTML).
  - In this example, you're showing how you could define a variable called "name"
    with the value "Kabelo", but since it's commented out, it wonâ€™t execute.
-->

<h1>Hello, <%= name %></h1>
<!-- 
  The <%= ... %> tag outputs the value of a variable directly into the HTML.
  - Here, it inserts the value of "name" dynamically.
  - For example, if the server sends { name: "Kabelo" },
    the rendered HTML will display:
        <h1>Hello, Kabelo</h1>
  - This works because your Express controller passes "name" to this EJS view,
    for example:
        res.render("index", { name: paramsName });
